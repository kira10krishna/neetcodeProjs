Proactive Practice Programs from NeetCode:
* I had to sleep on my laptop while cooding
* Honestly I coulded get two problemm solved
* One was Amazon's interview question: 1st failed case test of Valid Sudoku
* Other was Facebook's interview question: Encode and Decode the strings


So I am leaving this practice, I think it's enouugh. Now back to my main prob. Jarvis.
